# Java CRUD Web Application

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application built using:
- Java (JDBC + Servlets)
- HTML & CSS for frontend
- MySQL database for storage

The project demonstrates how to integrate Java web technologies with a database, handle user input, and perform basic operations like adding, viewing, editing, and deleting records.
